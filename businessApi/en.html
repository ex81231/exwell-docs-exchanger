                        illegal actions, the Exwell.io platform utilizes all available means to ensure the security of
                        its clients and partners. A significant element of our security strategy is the detailed
                        verification of all clients and the protection of financial transactions. AML/KYC methods are
                        considered a primary mechanism for confirming the legality of actions by both individuals and
                        organizations. <br><br> The Exwell.io platform actively operates a risk assessment system
                        capable of automatically detecting suspicious transactions. In the case of suspicions, the
                        transaction may be suspended, and the client will be asked to undergo the AML/KYC procedure. For
                        confidentiality reasons, the details of the risk assessment criteria are not disclosed, however,
                        our system successfully contributes to the prevention of fraud and money laundering. <br><br>
                        Please note that Exwell.io may use the services of third-party service providers to carry out
                        AML/KYC procedures. All personal data is securely protected by our privacy policy. <br><br>
                        Exwell.io reserves the right to transfer data obtained during the AML/KYC process to law
                        enforcement agencies upon official requests. <br><br> We do not engage in cooperation with
                        individuals suspected of fraud or money laundering, or those whose funds come from illegal
                        sources. <br><br>
                        <h2>AML and KYC Methodology</h2> <br> 1.The Platform performs AML verification for incoming
                        transactions. <br><br> 2.AML procedures include the use of specialized tools to analyze
                        cryptocurrency transactions to identify funds with higher risks to the platform. <br><br> 3.If
                        the analysis of an incoming transaction shows an exceeded risk tolerance, the funds are subject
                        to additional verification. <br><br> 4.If the additional verification confirms that the funds
                        are linked to illegal activity or money laundering: <br><br> 4.1.The application is temporarily
                        suspended. <br><br> 4.2 The user should contact the support service with the transaction number
                        to undergo verification. During verification, documents for identification, photo or video, as
                        well as explanations about the origin of funds may be requested. <br><br> 4.3 After analyzing
                        the provided documents, measures are taken to exclude errors or falsifications. If necessary,
                        additional checks are performed on questionable transactions. <br><br> 4.4 If the verification
                        is successful, the funds are returned to the agreed address, less the network fee. <br><br> 5.
                        The user undertakes to provide the requested materials, to await the results of the verification
                        and to refrain from claims against the platform. <br><br> 6. If the analysis of cryptocurrency
                        assets reveals a risk higher than 60% or one of the following tags is detected:DARK SERVICE,
                        SCAM, STOLEN, MIXING (MIXER), SEXTORTION, RANSOMWARE, HACK, PHISHING, TERRORISM FINANCING,
                        FRAUD, BLACKLIST, STILL UNDER INVESTIGATION, CYBERCRIME ORGANIZATION, NARCOTICS, CHILD ABUSE,
                        HUMAN TRAFFICKING, SANCTIONS, then the transaction may be blocked until the KYC process is
                        completed. <br><br> 7.The Platform reserves the right to share the data collected under AML/KYC
                        procedures with the relevant authorities upon official request. <br><br> 8. If a user is
                        inactive for a long period of time and does not undergo AML/KYC, restoration of access to funds
                        or resumption of transactions is possible only after undergoing KYC. <br><br>
